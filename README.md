## About Me

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm an aspiring Data Scientist with a unique background as Senior Creature Technical Director at Lucasfilm Singapore.  
Strong in technical skills, with experience in creating Python tools to improve production processes.  Effective at problem-solving and devising practical solutions.  

I hold a Data Analytics/ Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree from Heicoders Academy and a Data Science Immersive Certification from General Assembly, providing me with expertise in SQL, Tableau, and Python for machine learning.  
I have experience working with various machine learning models using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. My technical proficiency and educational background empower me to deliver predictive modeling and data visualization solutions that improve business outcomes.   

## Projects

### Flask App, AWS, CI/CD: Customer Churn Prediction
This project encompasses a wide range of skills and technologies, including SQL queries, data visualization, building classification machine learning models, creating a Flask app with Python, HTML, and CSS, utilizing Docker, and deploying the application on AWS.  
Additionally, I set up an API to provide programmatic access to the model. I also built a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process. [Learn more](https://github.com/michaelkingsutanto/cutomer_churn_flaskapp_aws_cicd)

### Computer Vision: Singapore Traffic Object Detection
