## About Me

Iâ€™m a Data Scientist with a robust background as Senior Creature Technical Director in Lucasfilm Singapore. My role involved developing and creating Python tools to streamline workflows for both Sydney and Singapore teams. One standout project was the 2016 film 'The Great Wall,' where I developed a Python tool to automatically populate and execute 16,000 ragdoll creature simulations. This significantly reduced manpower and machine resource usage. Other significant projects included the 2018 'Bumblebee' movie and the 2024 'Transformers One,' where I engineered Python tools and established a pipeline to enhance transformation processes for both the Singapore and Sydney teams.  

I have developed a variety of ML/DL applications, including regression, classification NLP and computer vision projects, using both TensorFlow and PyTorch. Additionally, I have built cloud-based web applications on AWS with a CI/CD pipeline and API endpoints supporting POST requests, demonstrating my ability to integrate AI technologies into scalable, real-world applications.

## Projects

### Flask App, AWS, CI/CD: Customer Churn Prediction
This project encompasses a wide range of skills and technologies, including SQL queries, data visualization, building classification machine learning models, creating a Flask app with Python, HTML, and CSS, utilizing Docker, and deploying the application on AWS.  
Additionally, I set up an API to provide programmatic access to the model. I also built a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process. [Learn more](https://github.com/michaelkingsutanto/cutomer_churn_flaskapp_aws_cicd)

### Computer Vision: Singapore Traffic Object Detection
Utilizing the computer vision model YOLOv8 to detect local vehicles, traffic signs, and traffic-related objects in Singapore. [Learn more](https://github.com/michaelkingsutanto/GA_capstone_singapore_traffic_object_detection)

### Classification and CNN: Obesity and Stroke
Classify the level of obesity and the likelihood of having a stroke using a classification model. Additionally, analyze brain CT scan using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). [Learn more](https://github.com/michaelkingsutanto/GA_project4_classification_cnn_for_obesity_stroke)

### Web Scraping & NLP: Omega Watch
Leverage NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Bayesian network to inform our marketing decisions with confidence and objectivity, especially on copy that goes to brand taglines and marketing slogans. [Learn more](https://github.com/michaelkingsutanto/GA_project3_nlp_omega_watch)
