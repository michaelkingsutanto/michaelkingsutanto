Hi, I'm Michael. I'm an aspiring Data Scientist with a unique background as Senior Creature Technical Director at Lucasfilm Singapore.  
Strong in technical skills, with experience in creating Python tools to improve production processes.  Effective at problem-solving and devising practical solutions.  

I got my Data Science Immersive (full time) from General Assemble in May 2024 and got my Data Analytics Nanodegree (part time) from Heicoders Academy in April 2024.  

I specialize in predictive modeling, machine learning, and data visualization to help organizations leverage their data for improved outcomes.
